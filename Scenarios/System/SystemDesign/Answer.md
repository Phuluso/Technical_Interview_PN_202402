The design and implementation approach of such a project would include gathering requirements, planning, analysis, designing, building, testing and evaluating phases using an iterative approach. It requires a special focus on integration with existing services, scalability, security, and customer satisfaction. Below, I will outline the strategy from design to deployment and beyond. 

1. Requirements analysis and planning:

Initially, determing the stakeholders' and/or clients' needs, and systems requirements is important to establish by engaging with the potential clients to better understand their requirements for machinery monitoring. This is expected to cover information regarding the types of machines, data that needs to be tracked, the frequency at which data needs to be updated, any specific details in the form of notifications or reporting, and so on. 

Next, the service model needs to be defined, including the price per license. Determining the definition for a "license" in the context of the service provided is crucial (for example, is the application licensed per volume of data handled, per machine registered etc.).
