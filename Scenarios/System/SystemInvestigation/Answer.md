To diagnose this integrated system I would identify the period in which the system started to slow down and establish a performance baseline by collecting the systems current performance metrics.

The performance metrics would include: 

- The web applications load times
- API response times
- Database transaction times

Following on I would determine if there are any recent changes to the system that could have affected the performance in the period of the system performance degradation. These recent changes may include:

- Client application updates
- Web Application updates
- Database schema updates
- Api Updates
- Or any updates in the translation service
- As well as any increase in the number of users of the system and/ or amount of data being requested from the system.

Assess if any of the changes would have an effect on the performance of the application.

Next I would Isolate the components of the system (Web Application, API, Database, Translation service, Reporting service) and perform diagnistics for each component. I would start with the database component since it is the central component to all the others. The Question mentions that "The whole system" performance has degraded, therefore the likelihood of the issue to be the database is high. Following  on I would diagnose the translation service then the other components.

# Diagnostics
- Database: Perform query performance analysis, monitor any indexing problems and resource usage 
- Translation service: Monitor translation processing times and the logs for errors to identify inefficiencies 
- API: Perform API stress testing
- Reporting service: Test the report generation times and caching strategies
- Web Application

With the help of the above dignostics, we can identify where the bottleneck lies by correlating the recent changes to the results of the diagnostics.
